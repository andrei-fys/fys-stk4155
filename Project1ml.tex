\section{General description of the linear regression methods}
Regression analysis is a powerful tool to analyze the data. Let's start with some definitions needed to understand how it works.
\begin{defn}
Variables $\hat{x} = [x_0,x_1, x_2,\dots, x_{n-1}]^T,$ are called independent  or explanatory variable. Here $n$ is number of samples measured.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Variables  $\hat{y} = [y_0,y_1, y_2,\dots, y_{n-1}]^T,$ are called dependent or response variable. Here $n$ is number of samples measured.
\end{defn}
The aim of the regression is to estimate the relationship between $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ variables in order to make predictions and find functional dependences. \\
Let's assume we measure a set of parameters for each sample. Number of parameters is denoted by $p$. In this case instead for vector we would get a matrix $\textbf{X}$ and $\textbf{Y}$. Matrix $\textbf{X}$ is called \textbf{design matrix} and matrix $\textbf{Y}$ is \textbf{response matrix}. Goal of regression analysis is to determine the functional dependence between $\textbf{X}$ and $\textbf{Y}$ or one may say explain one in terms of the other. Here we have no knowledge on the function is available in advance. However one may assume the function to be linear with respect to some unknown parameters $\beta = (\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p)^{\top}$.Such assumption leads to so called \textbf{linear regression} and set of $\beta$  are \textbf{regression parameters}. There are many types of linear regressions and in the sections below we are going to describe some of them.
\subsection{Ordinary Least Squared}

\subsection{Ridge}

\subsection{Lasso}

\subsection{Resampling methods}
As we have already mention the main goal of regression analysis is to find the relations between the dependent and independent variables by estimating set of parameters. Once we have sampled the date and run the regression analysis we have obtained this parameters. However we only can do it once for a single data sample and can't predict how the model we have made will explain new data. The process of colllecting data might also be expensive both in computational time and in real life currency, so one might need a recipi to avoid collecting more data and re-use the existing. Another problem here is so-called over-fitting. Regression analysis is base on the idea of prediction for the value based on some already known sets of variables and
